The SIGMA templates and atlases for the Wistar Rat Brain

The current document is a short description of the SIGMA resources for the Wistar Rat brain. For a full description of the resources and the methodologies used to create them please consult the main publication (Barriere D.A. and Magalhaes R., et al 2019, Nature Communication, in press).

The SIGMA resources are a set of standardized MRI compatible templates and atlases meant to support the analysis of multimodal MRI data of the rat brain. They were developped as part of the SIGMA project, a collaborative project between French (CEA and INSERM) and Portuguese (ICVS) institutions (FCT-ANR/NEU-OSD/0258/2012). They provide a unified and standardized framework for the analysis of multimodal rat brain data, allowing the reporting of results using the coordinate system of the Paxinos-Watson atlas. 

The resources function in a common reference space and are: 
1/ a high-resolution (90 µm isovoxel) ex vivo T2*-weighted anatomical template and its associated GM, WM and CSF tissue probability maps (TPMs) for voxel-based morphometry analyses,
2/ an in vivo T2-weighted anatomical template and its associated GM, WM and CSF TPMs (150 µm isovoxel),
3/ an in vivo T2-weighted functional template and its associated GM, WM and CSF TPMs (300 µm isovoxel),
4/ an anatomical whole-brain atlas composed of 246 structures, derived from the merge of the Waxholm [Papp, E.A. et al 2014] and Tohoku [Valdes-Hernandez, P.A. et al 2011] atlases. The anatomical brain atlas is provided at the highest resolution (90 µm isovoxels).
5/ a functional brain atlas composed of 59 structures. This functional brain atlas is provided at three resolutions (90 µm, 150 µm and 300 µm isovoxels).

Additionnally, we propose a brain mesh suitable for data visualization with common neuroimaging software.

SIGMA ressources are provided at the scanner resolution and are oriented in anterior commisure/posterior commisure axis. Center of the images have been set at the anterior commisure level (Bregma 0 mm). Nevertheless, users are invited to increase the resolution of the current images for using in SPM or FSL for accurate coregistration and normalization steps (we recommand x10 increasing).
